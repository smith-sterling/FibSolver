# FibSolver
I was looking into fibonocci sequence solver stuff a while back, and of course the infamous O(2^n) way is unnaccaptable, and the linear way is one that is super easy to implement to do the same thing, but I came across a way that is O(log n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity, so I had to code it up, just for fun
